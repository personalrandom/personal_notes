estrogen domination

main suspect : estrogen sulfate !
	E1S levels are much higher than those of estrone and estradiol, and it is thought to serve as a long-lasting reservoir for estrone and estradiol in the body
	E2S has been found to act as a potent inhibitor of glutathione S-transferase an enzyme that contributes to the inactivation of estradiol via conversion of it into an estradiol-glutathione conjugate

does tamoxifen help in any of these sulfates ?

estrone-3-sulfate sulfate is the most abundant estrogen in women at all ages as well as in men

estrogen sulfotransferase
	catalyser(increases the rate, accelerates) for the transformation of estrogen into sulfated estrogen(the fat stored estrogen)
	Steroid sulfatase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reverse reaction
	Estradiol 17beta-dehydrogenase : increases the rate of conversion from estradiol to estrone 
		calcitriol, up regulates this Attention!!!
		
estrogen receptor antagonist :
	FULVESTRANT
	costs 500 euros damn, maybe find a cheaper website?	https://eu-aibolit.ru/protivoopukholevye/15045-fazlodeks-250-mg5-ml-shpric-2-sht-v-kompl-s-igloj-steriln-faslodex-fulvestrant.html

there's sulfates for everything : dhea E1 adione

Polar estrogen sulfates, particularly, E1S, are taken up into cells by specific transport proteins from different families of SLC transporters including the family of organic anion transporters SLC21 or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs).
	Within this concept, transporters from the OATP (SLC21) family such as OATP1A2, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, and OATP3A1 contribute to the cellular accumulation of E1S
	while ABC-efflux pumps from the MRP-family (ABCC1 and ABCC2), and the breast-cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) mediates the efflux of E1S from the cells
	

Things taht I think might work
	workout
	fat loss using anavar
	gynecomastia to remove breast tissue
	ai because there's still some testo sulfate and dhea sulfate and some endogonous production
