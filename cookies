First recipe to test :

Ingredients:
	1 egg
	85g sugar
	85g butter -> 100g butter
	150 farine T55
	pepites de choloat 100g -> 100g tablette chocolat 70% : 
		How to cut tablette de chocolat ?
	1 sachet sucre vanillé -> use vanilla extract ?
		the problem is that it adds moisture. which is ok?
		1 teaspoon
	1 tablespoon levure chimique
	1/2 tablespoon salt : Maybe use more ?

Preparation :
	1 Laissez ramollir le beurre à température ambiante. Dans un saladier, malaxez-le avec le sucre.
	2 Ajoutez l'oeuf et éventuellement le sucre vanillé.
	3 Versez progressivement la farine, la levure chimique, le sel et les pépites de chocolat. Mélangez bien.
	4 Beurrez une plaque allant au four ou recouvrez-la d'une plaque de silicone. À l'aide de deux cuillères à soupe ou simplement avec les mains, formez des noix de pâte en les espaçant car elles s'étaleront à la cuisson.
	5 Faites cuire 8 à 10 minutes à 180°C soit thermostat 6. Il faut les sortir dès que les contours commencent à brunir.

Let's try this first.

190° 9 minutes 10 sec if sorti du frigo + 9 cookies
250 beurre demi sel => 230g beurre demi sel
200 g white (granulated) sugar => 170g white sugar
220 g light bro                                                                 wn sugar packed
2 tsp pure vanilla extract
2 large eggs => 2 medium eggs
360 g all-purpose flour t65 => 60g gruau 300g t65 ( I think no because what makes the cookie heavy is the fiber and stuff)
1 tsp baking soda
½ tsp baking powder
1/2+ tsp sea salt (rempli ++)
350 g chocolate chips (or chunks, or chopped chocolate)

next time:

dont use mixer when mixing in the chocolate chips.
cut the chocolate chips with pressure, and get rid of the debry
you can use less white sugar, more brown sugar so they're thicker.
bigger chunks of chocolate
dont over cream butter and sugar
let the thing cool a bit before cooking
use 70% chocolate only

try mixing t80 with t65
	try 100g t45 gruau + 260 t80
