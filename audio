casque + mic:

mic : modmic 
	does it support the thing where you hear your own voice ?
		if not, it's openback
		
Project idea :
	3.5mm to 5GHZ sender/receiver

airpod max vs  fidelio x2hr vs hd560s vs hd6XX

	fidelio x2hr : at 100e : buy
	hd560s : not enough bass too flat.
	hd6XX : not sold in france

You need Planar Magnetic
	nice bass and fund sound signature
	Monolith M1060 is a nice example
		M1070 ?
	hifiman HE400 something ? 
		HE4XX is the one availabe I think
		HE400S expensive and not that available
		Sundara : not enough bass need to be eq bass boosted
	High end :
		LCD-2C

V-shaped sound signature ?

what about akg ? see that dealabs guy
	AKG K701

Hifiman HE400i 2020 Edition
	adding +2db to 31 ,62, 125hz lows become thicker, warmer without any distortion its like they where hidden there all along,   and  just -0.5 db to 4 ,8, 16 khz and trebe becomes almost perfect cause stock is little harsh
	Use them only with stationary amp (1.5-2W)

You need a dac + amp because output of tv/monitor is shit I think.
