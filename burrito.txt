the tortilla  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gaQfu_wPGw
450g flour
250ml
80g lard

=> makes 10 tortillas
	Let's make 4 max

=> How to keep tortillas fresh for atleast a day ?

one tortilla = 75-80g
	45g flour each
		= 34g carbs
	8g fat

Reasons why to make own tortilla
	More fat/less carbs
	bigger (wider + maybe thicker?) tortilla
		80g vs 40g
