1050e /100g torem

200mg = 500 days

0.5cc/day
100c = 200 days

-----
Primo 350mg/w
    cost : 150e/200days 
        22.5e/month

tren 100mg/w
    androgenic
    helps with eliminating estro

Torem 200mg/day
    63e/month
        seems that 20mg tamox is same as 60mg torem
        seems to increase panic attacks
        eliminated for now. (unless i cant metabolise tamox, which doesnt look like it)
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6
            north africans are more likely to be hypermetabolizer
                so normally i'm good

Enclomiphene
    no or positive effect on shbg (Good)
        these guys even had an increase in shbg : 
            https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/rir2et/8_month_results_of_enclomiphene_tadalaphil_bloods/
            https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/15a7vns/enclomiphene_before_and_after_8_weeks/
            https://www.reddit.com/r/enclomiphene/
    $268/10g
    oral(good)
    what's the standard dose ?
        12.5mg : 17e/month
    what about clomid ?
        (instead of tamox + enclo)
        nope because zuclomifene is Estrogenic in brain.
    best research on this https://www.fertstert.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0015-0282%2814%2900537-8
    is it really anti estrogenic ?
        see people experience in reddit

    
todo look for you shbg bloods

once you establish some protocol 
    shbg
    e2, e1, e3
        free version of these ?
    other estrogens
    
fulvestrant 500 mg/month : 100e/month
    no effect on shbg (Good)
    not metabolised in cyp3 enzymes (Good)
    apparently shouldn't block estro in brain(?)
    painful injections (bad)
    eliminated for now    
    
masteron/proviron
    anti estrogenic
    cheap
    lowers shbg
    can it work ?
    
    
--------------
I think tamox should be 100mg max

we need an anti estrogen for the remaining estrogens
    tren
        no binding to shbg
        progesteron effects may kick estro out of cells
        toxic
            high bp
            paranoid
        might fuck shbg the most
    primo
        no binding to shbg
        not too much lowering shbg
        clean
    mast/prov
        Binds to shbg
            will it work ?
        Best anti estrogens
    enclo
        no effect on shbg
        is it anti estrogenic ?
    fulvestrant
        no effect on sgbg
        can't inject enough to have an effect maybe
        

------------
Options :
100mg tamox + primo/tren/mast/prov + enclo/fulvestrant

Ideal :
100mg tamox + 200-350mg primo + 25-100mg enclo
    if enclo is good anti e
    if primo doesnt fuck shbg too much
    if primo + enclo is anti e enough

maybe we need 25-50mg/w tren e (for progesteronic effects)
    (to eliminate estro)
    2 small injection a week
        try subq
    MAYBE, MAYBE NOT
        will try first without..


Approach :
1- tren 100mg/w + tamox 100mg/d : for 6-8 weeks
    3-4 weeks for tamox
    3-4 weeks for shbg
    22/01-05/02 you're good.
- How you feel/look : note this
- Take bloods: fasting in the morning
    shbg e1,e2,e3, free e2
        (atleast shbg, e2)

2- Add 50mg enclomiphen (80mg of ours) : for 4 weeks
Feels + Bloods.
If good effect @4 weeks keep.

3- Add 25mg proviron : 4 weeks
Feels + Bloods.
If good effect @4 weeks keep.
    This means shbg binding stuff works.
        masteron will work too.

4- Switch to x mg primo instead of tren. 5-7 weeks
    2-3 weeks for levels to stabilise
    3-4 weeks for shbg to stabilise



----------
todo first before deciding :

research enclo
    shbg : neutral according to research
    sides : ok according to research
    anti estro effects : needs research
    effectif dose : 12.5 (we will take x4)
    price : 68e/month
    oral

research fulvestrant
    shbg : neutral according to research
    sides : ?
    anti estro effects :
    effectif dose : 500mg/month (will take x2)
    price : 72e/month
    painful injections (50mg/ml)
        2 ass cheeks per week (2.5cc each)

research proviron and masteron (separatly)
    shbg
        proviron bad binding affinity : elimnated for now
        masteron half binding of test, same as e2 : not bad
    anti estro effects
    sides

research primo
    shbg
    anti estro
    sides
    price : 21e/month (350mg/w)
        negligeable


-------------------
Theories:

fulvestrant/enclo dont lower shbg but have anti e effect
    or lowering of shbg is less important than anti e effect
    likeliness : +++
    Need to choose whether to test fulvestrant or enclo first.
        Do more research on enclo to see if it has anti e effects.
            if inconclusive : test enclo first since it takes less time to have an effect
                (4 weeks)
                if you feel good anti e effects : no need to try fulvestrant
                else
                    remove enclo and try fulvestrant
    
high tamox + high andro is better than high tamox + medium andro
    can test this by adding primo 350-455mg/w
        (since tren is toxic)
    likeliness : ++

masteron/proviron anti E effect is more important than lower shbg effect
    likeliness : +
    research if proviron is viable test option.
    
tren progesteronic effect helps get rid of e2
    likeliness : ++
    Cannot confirm/deny this so we have to keep tren @25mg/w mini


-----
we have 1100 tabs of tamoxifen

----
Things we will try :

01/01 : Add masteron or primobolan
    250mg mast or 350mg primo
        For now : primo wins because low binding affinity to shbg, low impact on liver
            better for skin and stuff
Try primo for 6 weeks
    you might feel better at first, but you need to feel better @6 weeks mark to be conclusive
Maybe increase tamox to 150mg
Maybe drop tren to 25mg and introduce mast@ 250

============================================================================
DIM seems to lower estradiol but upper estrone ?
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXPXp4HQUl8&ab_channel=VigorousSteve

estrone then metabolises to 16α-hydroxyestrone in some cases
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/estrone-derivative#:~:text=Estrone%20can%20be%20metabolized%20in,primarily%20toward%20the%2016%20metabolites.

=====================
Left to try : fulvestrant and enclomiphene

torem if tamox dont work

research what genetic testing todo

Phase 1 : DIM

Phase 2 : Methylation pathway : 
    SAM-E
    Methyl B12 : helps produce this SAM E
    TMG ?

Phase 3 : Gut microbiome can produce beta-glucuronidase
    Calcium d glucarate helps here
    probiotics (L. acidophilus NCFM®, Bifidobacteria),

Latest understandings of estrogen metabolism

E2 -> 2-OHE2, 4-OHE2
    This is hydroxylation
        2-OHE2 : CYP3A4, CYP1A1
        4-OHE2 : CYP1B1
        estriol : pregnant only maybe
        2-OHE1
            estrone one
            most abundant estrogen in body
    Phase 1 metabolism
    

2-OHE2, 4-OHE2 <-> quinones : E2-2,3-Q ,E2-3,4-Q
    This is Oxydation
    Can be converted back
        understand how ?
    Glutathione can conjugate quinones
        What happens to them later ?

Glucorination
    β-glucuronidase reverts this
        calcium d glucarate inhibits this
        
It seems that major route is estrone ?

estriol pathway :
    16α-OH Estrone to estriol
        Need to understand this pathway more.


What about Lipoidal estradiol ?
