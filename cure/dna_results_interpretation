Genetic results

Fast COMT : warrior gene
Bad MTHFR 
medium MTRR
    Need more b12
medium BHMT
    homocysteine to methionine alternate path
        (that uses choline)
Bad MAO
Medium VDR
    (vitamin D)

CBS
    very fast
        overproduction of ammonia and/or a decrease in glutathione
    Need least b6

CYP3A4
    Good
CYP1A2
    medium
CYP2D6
    Bad
NAT2
    Slow acetylator due to N-acetyltransferase 
glutathione S-transferase (GST)
    Good

MTHFR protocol
    https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1730mw4/mthfr_a_supplement_stack_approach/
== COMT
Needs Magnesium
Needs SAM
    This is the result of methylation cycle
        slow mthfr = less SAM

Dont have my genes for this
