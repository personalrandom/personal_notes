=== Injury stack
Use only when injured

GHK-CU, TB500, BPC157
    
=== Cerebrolysin
Always on : once a week + 4 cycles a year
    Add HGH and fish oil

=== SS-31
Might be useful to do 1-2 cycles a year
    Useful as long as we're still intoxicated with omega 6
        Process takes 4 years or so
        PUFA should be depleted slowly as it is toxic to liver
