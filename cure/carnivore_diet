b12 : kidneys, meat
    + supplement 5000mcg * 2
    for MTRR
methylfolate : supplement 15mg * 2

    divide into two doses
magnesium : supplement 4 * 100mg magnesium glycinate
    Cofactor for COMT
    1 morning
    1 lunch
    1 dinner

creatine : 3g
    less load on mthfr
Taurine 2g: 1 small scoop
    for BHMT
    Note : CBS heterozygous may mean you already have too much taurine.
    Theory : supplementing this will increase glutathione ?
vitamin C : 4 scoops (1600mg)
    for PON1 + antioxidant
        TODO : recheck PON1 claim
            negligeable
            done by reducing oxidants
    => Remove
       Not needed on carnivore, just eat rarish steak
       Bad : Increases oxalates
       Bad : Increases iron consumption (high in meat already)
NAC : 4 scoops (1500mg)
    Needed for lowering inflammation
    Make sure to get enough copper from liver (200g/week)
    If you take enough b vitamins and proteins(cysteine) shouldn't be needed
        will keep until we heal from inflammation for now.
Vitamin E ?
    antioxidant
TUDCA 2 (on empty stomach : morning, before sleep)
    liver support

    Inhibits CYP1B1 (Good)

Potassium 1g x 3 /day (+2000mg from foods)
    needed on carnivore + needed for extra methylfolate
    --

BPC157, TB500
Thymosin alpha 1
    use until less inflammation
--------

juice 1/2 lemon morning and night
    (if you feel oxalate dumping symptoms: painful urination)
        if too bad, drink green tea
            black tea is even higher in oxalates

vitamin C : 1
NAC : 1
TUDCA : 1

calcium d glucarate : 2

== Meal 1

== Meal 2
creatine : 1
vitamin d3 : 1
Iodine : 1
------------
Timing:
Supplements timing : 
- Tudca     : wakeup, 2h before dinner

- all others: 15 minutes before meals
--------
== Maybe unecessary

iode : supplement
    Maybe you eat enough : Cheese, shrimp, iodized salt, eggs
---------
== Not supplemented
choline : 6 eggs/day
    converts to TMG
    BHMT
    
b3 : beef, chicken
b6 : beef, chicken
    I get just enough = Good 
    I have fast CBS so I shouldn't take too much
b5 : beef
zinc : beef, shrimp/calamar
    High Zinc helps keep copper low
vitamin A : 200g liver every two weeks
    + eggs, cheese, butter
Selenium : meat, eggs
Molybdenum : eggs, meat, liver
l-carnitine : meat
-----------
To avoid for now (depends on dutch test)
dim : depends on dutch test
    Problem : it's an anti androgen
    200mg max.
    CYP1A1 gene is good already
-----------
Approach :
    Eat 6 eggs a day (or atleast the yolk)
    Eat 300g liver twice a week
    Supplement
        magnesium oxide/malate

    CHDH gene (converts choline to betaine) : rs12676, rs1025689
        ref : https://www.wellesu.com/10.1371/journal.pone.0036047
lithium?
selenium ( B2 activation)
    Getting 400mcg from food (more than 400% rdi)
    200mcg in 1Kg beef : OK
Molybdenum, 
    B2 activation (which is needed by B12)
    enough from eggs + liver

    SOD enzyme
    0 from diet
    TODO
