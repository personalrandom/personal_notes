metabolism of estrogens

on of major routes is Hydroxylation of estradiol
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylation_of_estradiol

DIM seems to lower estradiol but upper estrone ?

estrone is the major estrogen found in women in post menopause

    Phase 1 : CYP1A1 and others
        I have good CYP1A1 genes => 2-0HE1
    Phase 2 : Methylation
        2-OHE1 : major cachetol
    Phase 3 : glucuronidation (UGT) and sulfation (SULT)

We need :
e2,e1,e3 test

what's 3,4-Quinones ? 
    aka estrogen quinones
    it seems that mainly glutathione (GST) detoxifies this
        How to max out glutathione ?
    some schemas show that it's reversible to 2-OHE1, 4-OHE1
        with quinone reductase

    NQO1 transforms them into hydro quinones

        Quercetin, Resveratrol upregulates this gene expression
        I have medium activity of this gene
    Both GST and NQO1  detox quinones
        https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/estrogen-how-it-is-made-and-how-we-get-rid-of-it/
    Can we test for this ?
    Is this reversible to 2-OHE1, 4-OHE1 ?

Reducing sensitivity of estrogen receptor ?
    Resveratrol, xanthohumol ?
    
Relative binding affinity of estrogen metabolites : ER, SHBG

How to deal with Estrogen stores
    Lipoidal estradiol
        Can you test for this in your fat ?
    estrogen sulfate?
    
Is my phase 3 optimized ?
    SULT and UGT

==== Upregulation
- Nrf2 pathway
- Supplements
    Resveratrol
    Quercetin
==== Research
This shows that quinones are reversed with NADPH (encoded by NQO1 gene)

What's NAD+/NADH
    + full cycle : this seems interesting https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/16nk13l/niacin_increases_this_mans_nad_levels_more_than/
is Nicotinamide riboside an inducer for NAD ?
    What about Nicotinamide monouncleotide ?
        (I think both are NAD+ activators)
        They're B3 ?
Understand this quinone cycle perfectly
Do you need to IV NAD+ and Glutathione ?
    They say no need to supplement NAD directly but just the precursors NMN
