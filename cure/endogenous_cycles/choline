CDP-choline : supplement form, converted into PC with PCYT1A gene
    Bad PCYT1A gene : can't use this supplement
Alpha-GPC : I can use
eggs choline : main form Phosphatidylcholine (PC)
    This is the one needed for NAFLD

- PC can be produced internally using SAMe as donor with PEMT
    (Uses up some of methylation for this)
    => Give body enough PC so it doesn't need to produce its own

- PC can be converted to TMG which is used as alternative to folate in methylation cycle
    TMG : Alternative methylation pathway

- bad CHKA gene : much less methionine to choline internally. Need Choline from diet.
