Genetic data study

== Equivalences
A : T
G : C


Be skeptical about orientation when :
an (A;A) genotype call when the alleles are A and T
a (T;T) genotype call when the alleles are A and T
a (C;C) genotype call when the alleles are C and G
a (G;G) genotype call when the alleles are C and G


What about D and I ?
    Deletion : _,_
    Insertion : 
    
------------
Wild type homozygous : no mutation
mutant hetero : one allele mutated
mutant homo : 2 alleles mutated

Example : G=0.24041, C=0.75
    C is wild type common one : 75% population
    G is mutant : 24% population

SNVs/SNPs (single nucleotide variants)
INDELs (insertion and deletion variants)
CNVs (copy number variations)
SVs (structural variations)
