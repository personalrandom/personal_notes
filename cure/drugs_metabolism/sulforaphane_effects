sulforaphane interaction with phase 1 metabolism

1- sulforaphane inhibitor of cyp3A4
    This is Good : less 16a-OH
    antagonist of SXR( aka PXR) : SXR is responsible of upregulating CYP3A4
    Ketoconazole does the same thing for CYP3A4

2- Sulforaphane metabolites can decrease CYP2D6
    Very small inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6
    Weakly interacted with CYP2D6
    Conclusion : nothing to see here, just metabolites effect at max concentration

3- Sulforaphane and analogues inhibit CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 induction by benzopyrene
    In breast cancer cells but not liver
    Small inhibition of the effect of benzopyrene
    Sulfo induces CYP1A1 in hepatic cancer cells
    Conclusion : nothing to see here, cancer cells act different and doses are huge to achieve small decrease

4- Sulforaphane induces CYP1A1 in human hepa cancer cell
    Conclusion : same as 3, nothing to see here

5- Sulforaphane blocks induction of TCDD in some liver cancer cells
    Conclusion : doesn't mean anything in our case
