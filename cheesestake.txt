tips:
you can spread the dough on plaque metalique directly
	(or use the pizza peel)
use small chair and put dough in front of the oven
at the lowest rack, put cast iron skillet.
	when wanting to put bread, remove the rack and put skillet directly on bottom of oven

It seems like chaleur statique is best

- let dough rise enough next time
- put a bit of olive oil on the pan next time
	+ spread good with polenta
---
we're trying one with polenta on top
	and one with semoule fine en top
		polenta wins
---

to create vapeur in oven :


---
put skillet or some plate in bottom
	bottom rack : steel plate
	middle rack the bread
let them heat like this

pour very small quantity of water on skillet
