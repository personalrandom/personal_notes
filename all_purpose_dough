All purpose dough :

1kg flour
3.5 tbsp olive oil
    might change to 3
    maybe you can add this later to each dough separatly ?
70% hydration
    will try 65% too to see
    (best for ciabatta and baguette)
3.75 tsp salt
3.75 tsp yeast

produces around 1765g dough

+ 250g dough from previous batch
    note : you might not need yeast


This should last around 5 days up to 2 weeks
Dough should be made night before
    even if you dont have time to kneed it just make it overnight !

kneed it once a day preferably (when you use it)
