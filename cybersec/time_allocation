Time allocation

I can reach (with determination and hard work) :
10h/day on weekends
4h/day on workdays
+ I can borrow company time I'm very efficient at my work

= 40h/week of working on side stuff
    +6h/day if I can borrow
    I think I can reach 46h/week without no one noticing

------------
Let's do 2 hours a day everyday for 1 month first.
