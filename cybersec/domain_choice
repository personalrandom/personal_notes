= Chosing a domain

== First task : list all possible cybersec domains
=== For each one :
- Fun factor
- How complex is this
- can you make 12-50k/y consistently with this
- What is the potential money here
- What are the clients and do they pay
- How big is the market

= Domains I'm aware of
== Web
== Windows stuff
== Smartphone stuff
== Browsers
== Cloud/servers/virtualization
== Embedded
== Hardware
== Linux kernel ?
== Consoles
== Online video games

= Domains on hackerone

= Domains with bug bounty program

= Things that interest me the most
== Windows
== Smartphones
== Web
== Online video games

-------------------------------
Opensource vs closed source ???
-------------
= Android
Open source
Lots of vectors of attack
    app, linux, android, hardware specific stuff, wireless protocols..
4.4M$/y pool
List of reported CVEs
    https://source.android.com/docs/security/overview/acknowledgements
    https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-02-01
Google in general :
    Pays for vulns in nearly anything related 
    Pays for patches
= IOS
+ safari

-------------
= chrome/chromium
Closed source ?
4M$/y pool
= firefox

-------------
= Linux kernel
Is there a bug bounty ?

-------------
= Hardware specific
Tesla


-------------
= Xbox

-------------
= Virtualization
kvm, hyper-v
vmware others
-------------
= Web
It's fun to hack websites
Seems like you can make looots of money
The biggest
Lot of potential

-------------
= Linux servers
-------------
= Video games
Epic games
===========================================================
- Big bug bounty payers
Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon



Too small :
    Netflix
= Meta
Web
-------
- Bug bounty sites
bugcrowd.com

====================================
Ranked by order of interest for now
Most important question is :
    How much time to make 5k (atleast twice a year)
====================================
= Android
== les + 
Max fun
Stuff learned transitions to :
    ios, windows, embedded, console, tesla, hardware, etc
Can help your career
    Google opportunities
    Linux freelancing
OS is opensource
Google pays well
Highest potential for money
    zerodium

== les -
Infinite complexity
Needs hardware
    pixel 6a : around 220euros
        support until July 2025 : android version
        support until July 2027 : cybersec updates

== les ?
What's the expected invesment before making 1k/month
    should be less than 2 years

--------------------------------------
= Web
== les + 
Make money faster
Fun to hack a website

== les -
No transition to other domains
I have 0 technical knowledge
Too much competition

== les ?
What's the expected invesment before making 5k/6months


--------------------------------------
= chrome
== les + 
bound environment and complexity
Google pays well

== les -
No transition to other domains
Not that fun maybe
Pure application

== les ?
What's the expected invesment before making 5k/6months

--------------------------------------
= Windows
== les + 
Very fun
Big framework/environment

== les -
Huge complexity
0 knowledge
windows is closed source
    Can be ok later once you master an os like Linux

== les ?
What's the expected invesment before making 5k/6months

--------------------------------------
= IOT
+ : Has lots of bugs
- : Need hardware
    Simulation ?
- : Might need C++
? : maybe vendors don't want to pay

---------------------------------------------

non web bug bounty is called binary exploitation

        get inspired
== approach
open source first
    close source : extra layer of reverse engineering
    move to close source afterwards
Understand all basic principals
Read up and reproduce exploits
Develop exploits for 1 days ?
read exploit write ups

internet bug bounty on hackerone : opensource projects
===============
Let's do by elimination

1- Web
    can I eventually make 12k/y ?
2- IOT + hardware
    !!!! Do you really need the hardware ? !!!!
    Emulation ?? Qemu, etc
3- Android + linux in general
4- Chrome, firefox, safari 
    Hard target like android
5 - Web3 (crypto and others)
    they pay a lot !
6 - virtualisation
7- Google cloud, azure, aws
Get inspired by blackhat/defcon
    
===================
Choice : Android + Linux in general and averything related
Problem : very hard target
Solution : freelance 1.5 month/y atleast to survive + have fun

Big question :
    How to build my freelance + learn for cyber ?
        freelance : Learn everything about Linux kernel + contribute + blog
        cyber : Learning inner workings of linux kernel = good investment ?



Potential next targets:
    Move to closed source targets : IOS/MAC/Windows
        + hardware specific : tesla; xbox
    Play with web browsers
    

=======================
Selling android/linux zero days
1- Google program
2- ZDI
    + pwn2own
3- Not selling but reporting
4- Zerodium
    (not until you have lots of vulns you're known for)
        Just use broker then

================
It seems that most popular targets are :
    Browsers
    virtual machines
    tesla
