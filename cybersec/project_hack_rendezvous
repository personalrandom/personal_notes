Script ?

https://www.rdv-prefecture.interieur.gouv.fr/rdvpref/reservation/demarche/4502/creneau/
    how it looks like when you can reserve

Some starting point for script : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjIFoNoDhz0

Strategy :
    try hacking captcha : https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/captcha-bypass
    Captcha solver
    Refresh every 1 minute
        Send email if new creneau
    Session is alive for : 30 minutes
        I can be solver of captcha
            Script email me captcha and I send response.
    Script works from 9h to 00h
        if captcha response not received, that 30 minute range is skipped.

--------------
= Try hacking captcha

Server generates a unique ID then gives image
Client sends response of the image then request to go to next step
    Server can refuse or accept based on session ID


== Pre solving captchas
Strategy = solve 30 captchas per day the same time


1 presolve
    ok
Presolve multiple captchas then use them
    ok

Using on different session
    ok

Using them later + 30 minutes 
    nope doesn't work

--
What if I put bad captcha everytime so my session stays valid
    doesn't work
