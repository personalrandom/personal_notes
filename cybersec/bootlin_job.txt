-------------------------------------------------------

Why I want to change :
	Big company bullshit
	Afraid of not working anymore on technical challenges
	Not allowed to do opensource contribution
	0 experts autour de moi

Why remote :
	I applied for citizenship, can't change city
		won't waste 1.5 x 2 a day on this

What I can bring :
    Know people inside schneider
        I was in transversal team
    All technical challenges I take I suceed in.
    Fully autonoumous
        I do research or au pire read kernel source code
            (to understand unknown stuff)
            => Proof : read Intel pcie, ti pcie rc.. to design pcie network.

When presenting myself :
    Powerpoint with achievements

Salary :
	Ask 60k
	Hope for 55k
	Atleast : 50k
