First task cybersecurity :

What are all the possible domains
    potential money for each
    complexity of each
    fun factor of each
    Estimated time to learn it
        and get a vulnerability at it

I need some positivity
    Find people who do this as living

==========
= Goals
- make 1k/month
- sell a vuln for more than 10k
- sell a vuln for more than 100k
- sell a vuln for 0.5-1 milion
- Participate in defcon (presenter)
- Publish cybersec research paper
= Possible independant cybersec jobs
== White Hat
Bug bounty hunter
    same as cybersecurity researcher ?
Make a cybersec product ?
Maybe in futur :
    do cybersec consulting for firms or smt :audit; cybersec threat assesment; incident response; etc
== Side stuff
Youtube channel about this
    might make some ad revenue if interesting content
Blogs
    Good publicity if ever needed
== Grey hat
Bug bounty hunter + sell to state actors ?
== Black hat
Attack companies : ransomware/data leak
    sell data
Hack online videogames
Hack people and steal their money
    interesting : crypto
=========
= Inspirations
Darknet Diaries Podcast
    bug bounty hunter that made milion/y
    Episode 60
= Sources
ycombinator (hacker news)
=========
= Possible domains
== Web
== Windows stuff
== Smartphone stuff
== Browsers
== Cloud/servers/virtualization
== Embedded
== Hardware
== Linux kernel ?
== Consoles
== Online video games

=How to choose :
- Fun factor
- can you make 12-50k/y consistently with this
- What is the potential money here
- How complex is this
- What are the clients and do they pay
- How big is the market
=========
= How to get into this technically
== Reverse engineering
Malware reverse engineering
    Ghidra is a tool for example
x86 architecture
    assembly, debuggers
