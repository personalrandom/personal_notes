== Todos
- Understand linux OS security blocks
    LPE + RCE : see all bugs related to this and understand them
- Deep Understanding of Android main blocks

== Hard exploits
A perfectly chained attack would be : RCE + LPE
    Remote code execution (RCE) : zero click or one click
        This is the entry point of the exploit, it's front end apps like : message apps, chrome, media readers
    Local privilige escalation (LPE) : bypass of the system security : linux kernel, ASLR, CFI, Selinux, Trusty OS
        Should be the hardest, as it's related to the OS

== Android attack surface
Media playing
    vuln in video/audio/image/archive/pdf/etc readers
Linux kernel
    drivers
    android specific stuff
        hardware, firmware
    dm-verity
    GPU + opengl
    OS stuff : MMU, pages, IPC what else ??
    userspace stuff : cgroups, root, ??
protocols
    bluetooth, wifi, nfc, usb, etc..
Selinux
Opensource libraries
    Focus on one specific to android
Trusty OS
Big android apps
    Whatsapp (+ messaging apps in general)
chrome
    renderer rce ?
        (sandbox escape ?)
Android Runtime
Framework ??
