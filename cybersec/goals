= Goals

== Independant Survival
- Make 12k/y consistently
- Always have 24k savings

== Thriving
1- By good T2 (garage/terasse/classe C)
    100k-150k
2- 60k savings (5 years of life)
3- make 24k/y consistently
    Once you make this for 3 years : apply citizenship

== Thriving +
- Move to spain
    Need french citizenship
    or Move to south of france (if no citizenship yet)

== Thriving ++
- 250k in stocks
- Be able to give money (family/etc)

== Luxury
- Property
    500k Nice House (south of france or spain)
    200k house in kenitra    
- Cars (60-80k)
    Porsche cayman 981 gts
    Porsche taycan

=============
where to buy
=Montpellier
a partir de 100k
good one for 120k

= Carcassonne/castres
80k good t3

= perpignan
a partir de 50k

= Murcia/sevilla/valencia region
80-100k good t3

= Kenitra
25k good t3

================
acheter vs louer
120k acheter
    200e/mois : fonciere + copro
    10k frais notaire
    if bought in high credit, can sell in low credit at 25% after 5 years
    Let's say : you can sell after 3 years and + value = frais notaire
600e/mois louer

diff
400e/mois = 4.8K/an
    = 4%/an 

Bourse : Gain net apres inflation = 4%

I think gain wise : same.

I think that if I make an extra 120k, it would take atleast 3 years

it takes 2 years to get nationalité in grenoble
    6 months less in toulouse
    1 year more in montpellier
-----------------
Supposition of gains (brut)
year 1 : 0
year 2 : 0
year 3 : 12k
year 4 : 24k
year 5 : 48k
year 6 : 48k
    demande naturalisation here : ok
year 7 : 48k
year 8 : 48k
    Got naturalisation
year 9 : 48k
    Buy appartment
    
Scenario 2 :
year 3 : 78k
year 4 : 78k
year 5 : 78k
year 6 : 
    you can buy

Between the two scenarios, if you make lots of money you lose max 3 years
If you make good amount (scenario 1) you don't lose any time because of naturalisation

about naturalisation

etapes :
    https://www.easytrangers.com/t/statistiques-delais-traitement-dossiers-naturalisation-numero-1-du-12-02-2020/19446

it takes 13 months for entretien
    even here can be safe
2-5 months for reze
    they say here it's safe to change to salarié

Ok conclusion :
    See if I have everything 
        if missing stuff see if it's easy
    If you have atleast smic as freelance it's good
        3 years
