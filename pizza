active dry Yeast (levure boulanger):
	let it rehydrate in water 30C for 5-15 minutes
		Just use 20C for now + sugar
instand dry yeast : levure boulanger instantané:
	doesnt need to be rehydrated

1.5x if using ady

Comparing doughs: per 100g of flour

papa johns
Flour : 100g
4.28g sucre
7.3g vegetable oil (tournosol)

adam regusea :
100g flour
3g olive oil
1.66g sugar
---
Lets try adam regusea dough with 65% hydration

200g flour
130ml water
6g olive oil
	1.25tsp olive oil
0.5 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp idy
0.6 tsp salt (1/2 tsp bombée)

---
dough temp water temp formula
dough temperature 24-26C MAX
water(T) + flour (T) + air (T) = X*3
where X = 25C - Kneading(T)

22c today 
kneading adds 5C

22+22+x = 60
water should be 16C

	this guy channel is best
---
poolish ?
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElJFy8ACwEA

why use poolish :
	because if you let dough ferment for too long it can become a pancake
	so dough can stay strong and have that acidity
	
Sourdough ?

biga vs poolish

if you let poolish too long it will become runny (because more gluten will be broken down)

---
Room temperature and yeast quantity
	to experiment

dough rising time : depends on flour type ?

--
cold ferment vs room temperature ferment

---
diastatic enzyme, 
	what does it do ?

--
how much yeast to use ?
	1% ?
	1 tsp idy = 3g
	
---
Fold 2 times
	and then use olive oil
How to fold : https://youtu.be/x-8UoEgtt48?t=310
the folded side should be on the bottom

When it gets out of fridge,
	another fold
	then let it rise at room temp : final proof
		3 hours
	the side with folds should be bottom
---
what weakens gluten, is it bacteria or yeast ?
