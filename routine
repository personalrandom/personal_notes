tudca how to take it 
https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07WDMB8BS?reviewerType=all_reviews
TUDCA is not water soluble;e so drinking liquids after swelling this will leave the bitter tase in your mouth and gums. I put it it in my green drink that I add hemp oil to. After I jug it I take a teaspoon of unflavored and unsweetened probiotic yogurt and swish it around my mouth coating my gums then swallow. The bitter taste is gone! I have only taken this for 4 days but had more energy and focus after just the first dose. And intentional pain I was having is gone. I am sleeping more soundly, too. I have MS and this is supposed tp cross the blood brain barrier and help clear out damaged neurons and help create healthy neurons and mitochondria. Studies show it helps ALS, PD, and Alzheimers. Studies are being done with it for MS.
