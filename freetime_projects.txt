	What website provide info on that ?
		Analysis

		get the actual malware binary
		See how it behaves in real life : (before it's patched)
		optimize this process and understand the common tools used for malware analysis

Malware runtime analysis
	The malware is running and you need to understand what it's doing
	See what ressources it uses what it modifies
	What tools can I use for this?

Make your own malwares using a patched exploit
	run it on pre patch system

Understand what malwares do :
	Via analysing lots of them.

Find a non patched malware
	Analyse it and understand it

-Tools 
Dissassembly
Automating the dissassembly and detection of common pieces in malware


- Long term goals
Successfully analyse a non patched malware
	Publish this finding somehow : this is your CV
	This is a zero day
	Submit an android patch
		ok if no patch
Find a zero day (one not already used inside a malware)
	Once you get deeper understanding of android you might be able to do this
	Sell it ? Publish it ?
Automation tool for malware dissasembly
	database of analysed malware
	automate common parts
Antimalware for android
Antimalware + uses AI for android
	like sentinelone

=== Hack an online video game ===
-Android
Find some game that needs online servers and hack it
	reverse engineer communication protocol with server

	modify them to change something in game : trainer and cheats

-Long term goals
Successfully hack an android online game
Make money out of it
	Sell exploit as bot or cheat(closed source thing)
