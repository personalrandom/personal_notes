OSP here. One click cleaners work great. But you should from my experience use three clicks. Click and hold rotate 90 degrees let go. Click and hold rotate 90 the other and let go. Then finally click and hold and rotate 90 like the original.

My supervisor tried to tell me you only need one click with these. I rubbed my finger on the end pulled out a fiber scope and said see the dirt? Did one click was still dirty. Two. Better. Three clean. Nothing is one click.

Also FYI this is just for ultra polished ends that are flat. Not sure how the angled green ends are cleaned we don't use those.
