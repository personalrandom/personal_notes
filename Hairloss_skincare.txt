Facts :
- Topicals are localised to some extent
- Hair is more sensitive to androgens in some areas than in others
- Estrogen can be more in the hair than in the body with alfatradiol
- You are less genetically sensitive to androgens
- Most of the hair you lost is the most sensitive to hairloss
- You can chose when to be more androgenic
- You have less inflammation with keto shampoo
- You have more anagenism with castor oil
- Some steroids are more selective than others : anavar and primobolan
- Topcials absorption time matters : optimally it has to take 2 hours and not 5 minutes
- Hair shedding that is not miniaturised is not hairloss
- You can address different problems with different drugs (water retention with ace inhibitos,keto ; penis with cialis; etc)
- The more research and experimentation you do the best the outcome
- You're hot and smarter than average

As a result :
- You can use proviron once a day to peak from 18h to 00h (also help you with the workout), to peak in nightclubs/interviews
- Find the sweet spot for each drug
- Find the sweet spot vehicule for topicals
- While experimenting keep hair short : 20mm , also learn to cut hair
- You might find somethings that work even for libido and for brain etc

Side notes : 

why ketoconazole : 
 -remember when it helped you get rid of the scalp itch ;
 -also dandruff and helps topicals penetrate better
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Peau grasse mixte (assumption) ( will be using androgens so that's correct)

Skincare protocol :

morning cleanser then vitamin c serum + hydration + sunscreen
before bed cleanser then retin a + hydration

every 2 weeks dermarolling
neck everyweek dermaroll

buy a washing machine for hygiene


Cleanser : bioderma sebium
moisturiser : gel in the morning , cream at night

moisturiser cream (night) : nivea homme

Apply retin a and cream at the same time ?

------
More conservative approach :
morning : wash water, vitamin c serum, maybe sunscreen

night: cleanser, retin a, moisturiser


---------------------
October the first : atleast 74kg 10%

smell max : explore how you smell

Find optimal trt, maintain it for 3 months, gain atleast a kilo

Do an anavar cycle (30mg/day) (2 months) gain atleast a kilo

Go back to optimal trt, and grind until you're 77kg 10%

To do a cycle (npp one) you need a gf
You have now earned a cycle, Time to achieve super sayen : 80kg 10% (4-5 months)

Maintain 80kg 10% and do some other sport : mma for example.

Tips on the future trt :
you can try the following :
npp + primo
hcg + primo
test + primo

Shbg when low increases free estrogen a lot which fucks you.
Try everyday injection at night ( this way the free E2 has time to calm down during the night)
