Time managment

Weekdays :
1h30 lost on workout + preparing food / day
30minutes on eating and stuff

20h- 00h : 
	4 hours per day for own projects
--
weekend :
2h on stuff
+1h rest
(maybe 2 hours sometimes for a movie)
	10-12 hours per day for own projects

----
This is equivalent to : 20h + 12*2 = 44h/7 = 5.7-6.3 worked days.
	=> Even if you don't work on linux in work time, you can work on it more than you normally would.

----
Personal project = work linux stuff that needs to be done as long as it's not finished.
