Kernel technical projects
Note : If you need a target, use am64x sk


Project : Understand all elements of linux kernel
	Use books + code + research
	1- List all elements : scheduler; drivers; etc
	2- Understand what's the role of each (high level understanding)
	3- Understand how they're connected
	Final goal : You need to understand really how the code works.


Interesting EOC needs :
	HSR support on linux is shit
		no vlan
		buggy
	PTP
	Virtualisation
