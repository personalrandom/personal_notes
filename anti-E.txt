anti -E approach


tren 1.8g/week : purges estrogen from hidden cells
	binding affinity to shbg is low
	provides stable levels
	negligeable cost
	gives androgenicity
	inject 1ml per day using slin pins

	
	
fulvestrant 250mg/week : pure anti estrogen and degrades estrogen receptors.
	(2 injections)
	75e/month

Having high shbg : keeps estrogen non active
	workout (also cardio)
	no proviron
	Low carbs
		start at 150g and will eventually go to 75g with one pizza day/week
	metformin
		1start at 500mg per day then slowly increase
		500mg x 2/day
			max = 2g / day
	tamoxifen
		2x20mg/day 	
			will take it but need to research more the potential estrogenic effects
			one in morning one before sleeping
			watchout if it consumes a lot of cyp3a4 and stuff

enclomiphene 
	very expensive @200mg/day, costs 150e/month
	Let's try using it once we have a stable protocol and see its effect
	

taurine : helps with cramps
creatine : Helps with methylation of estrogen
DIM + calcium d glucarate : helps with metabolism of estrogen in blood
	stop taking for now until creatine is loaded
