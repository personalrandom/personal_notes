Dealing with social situations :

You'll deal with them when you're dealing with them.
	Do not prethink this stuff
	Follow these general guidelines
Apply this also on small talk situations

You're at war
	Fight the estrogen
	You have goals and a vision
	Defend yourself from others
Take your time to interract
	You don't have to be RT
Try to calm down and be more ironic about this
	You're not angry against them, you're angry against estrogen
Maintain your frame
	You who you are when you're alone should stay the same

YOU'RE AT WAR 
DONT GIVE UP
YOU CHOSE TO FIGHT
YOU'RE A WARRIOR

Basic rules :
- Do not try to prethink the social interraction
	That's you trying to be RT even thgough you're not.
- Do not think about imaginary situations and how to deal with them
	That's estrogen poisining your mind
- Others are shit at this too, because they're weak
	You're better than them even in this poisoned state.
- People's eyes on you have the same effect as estrogen
	fight that the same way.
	

Idea :
Try to apply this even at social interaction
